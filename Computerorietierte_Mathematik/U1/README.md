# Number-System transformation
1. If the length of the target binary number is smaller than the required length c, 
our solution is that we will add '1' in the front of the transformed binary String.

2. If a number is positive, than its two's complement is the same as its binary form.
However, when it is negative, then we have to complement it and then add 1. Meanwhile,
it's not terrible that overflows come up in this case.
